# Disease Spread Modelling
Modelling disease spread via C code

# The Model
1. All people within a certain distance of an infected person have a probability of getting infected
2. Every infected person is removed after some days as defined in the code
3. Only infected people can further the spread of infection

# Findings
1. Social distancing is very an exceptionally far reaching measure
2. A faster culling implies slower spread
3. Small changes can bring massive effects
